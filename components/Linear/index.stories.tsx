* Linear View

The /linear view/ allows one to study a documentation as linear prose. This is probably the more common way to observe a document.

** TODO Inventorize missing capabilities/features

At this point, some untested and definitely missing features are:
- lists
- radio links
- dates
- footnotes
- tags

** TODO Determine on sensible name for this

I've struggled with Linear as the name for the view a bit as it was previously called List and I needed to already rename in anticipation of real list that would need that name. Linear is not quite a proper noun for this view when looking at how clear of a name Board is but hey... naming is hard. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖ

* Background

The Storybook setup introduced =OrgLinear= which is merely a wrapper around the original =Linear= component which parses Org text and thus allows us to plug in Org raw text into the component directly and thus allowing for a better UX/DX as we can just play with Org text in the control and watch the magic happen. ü™Ñ

This wrapping pattern is demonstrated in the [[https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls#fully-custom-args][Storybook docs on fully custom args]] and hopefully isn't much of an anti-pattern. üòÖ

*** TODO Replace uuidv4 with uuid

Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid instead of https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4 as per UUIDv4's notice https://github.com/thenativeweb/uuidv4#please-note.

*** TODO Adapt parsing options based on document input

The =defaultOptions= for the uniorg parser sets =todoKeywords= to =TODO= and =DONE= (see [[https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg/blob/0970ebcb3040b10bea58aee7601b700320762420/packages/uniorg-parse/src/parse-options.ts#L31][src]]) which is in line with Org's defaults. Custom TODO keywords that are defined through the =TODO= keyword or its variants =TYP_TODO= are not being honored and thus these keywords are parsed as "just text".
